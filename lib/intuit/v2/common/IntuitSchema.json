Inventory items are not\n                currently supported.                   Product: QBW           Description: An item\n                is a thing that your company buys, sells, or re-sells, such as products, shipping\n                and handling charges, discounts, and sales tax (if applicable). An item is shown as\n                a line on an invoice or other sales form. An item helps you to fill the line item\n                area of the sales or purchase form quickly. When you select an item from the item\n                list, QuickBooks fills in a description of the line item and calculates the amount\n                for you. An item is of the following types: [li]Assembly Item: The Assembly item\n                allows you combine inventory part items and other assembly items (subassemblies)\n                into a single item by defining a Bill of Materials, that lists the component parts\n                of the assembly item. You can also include the cost of building the assembly item by\n                adding the non-inventory part items, service items, and other charge items to the\n                Bill of Materials. [/li][li] Fixed Asset Item: The Fixed Asset item represents those\n                business assets that you do not convert to cash one year of normal operation. A\n                fixed asset is usually something that is integral to your business operations. For\n                example, a truck or computer. [/li][li]Group Item: The Group item helps you to\n                quickly enter a group of individual items that you often purchase or sell together.\n                [li]Inventory Item: The Inventory item is used to track merchandise which your\n                business purchases, stocks as inventory, and re-sells. QuickBooks tracks the current\n                number of inventory items in stock and the average value of the inventory after the\n                purchase and sale of every item. [/li][li]Other Charge Item: The Other Charge item\n                is used to charge customers for the mileage expense.[/li] [li]Product Item: The\n                Product item is used to record the sales information of a product. [/li][li]Payment\n                Item: The Payment item subtracts the amount of a customer payment from the total\n                amount of an invoice or statement. You must create a payment item if you receive\n                payment for an invoice or statement in parts. If you receive full payment at the\n                time of sale, use a sales receipt form instead of an invoice with a payment\n                item.[/li] [li]Service Item: The Service item is used for the services that you\n                charge on the purchase. For example, including specialized labor, consulting hours,\n                and professional fees. [/li][li]Subtotal Item: The Subtotal item is used when you\n                want the total of all the items. You can use this item to apply a percentage\n                discount or surcharge.[/li]           Business Rules: [li]The item name must be\n                unique. [/li][li]The item type must not be NULL. [/li][li]The item cannot define\n                both unit price and unit price percent simultaneously. [/li][li]For the Service,\n                Product, and Other Charge items, you must specify the ID or name of the expense\n                account or both. [/li][li]If the purchase order cost is specified for the Service,\n                Product, and Other Charge items, you must specify the ID or name of the expense\n                account or both.[/li] For the Inventory and Assembly items, you must specify:\n                [li]the ID or name of the income account or both [/li][li]the ID or name of the cogs\n                account or both [/li][li]the ID or name of the asset account or both [/li][li]For\n                the Group item, you must specify the tax ID or tax name or both.[/li] For the Fixed\n                Asset item, you must: [li]set the asset account type to Asset[/li] [li]specify the\n                purchase date [/li][li]specify the ID or name of the income account or both[/li]"},"xs:complexContent":{"xs:extension":{"base":"CdmBase","xs:sequence":{"xs:group":[{"minOccurs":0,"ref":"ItemParentReferenceGroup"},{"minOccurs":0,"ref":"UOMReferenceGroup","xs:annotation":{"xs:documentation":"Product: QBW\n                                Description: [br /]UNSUPPORTED FIELD."}}],"xs:element":[{"form":"qualified","minOccurs":0,"name":"Name","type":"xs:string","xs:annotation":{"xs:documentation":"Product: QBO\n                                Description: User recognizable name for the Item.
